# TipTapMotor

## Print one of each STL, except for:
* "GearBoxAssy-Planet.STL", which needs a total of three.
* "SingleMotorPCBspacer.STL", which is optional, but needs a total of two.
Note: I used the LulzbotMini_TipTap.curaprofile on my lulzbot mini to get the tight tolerances needed on the gears and good first layer resolution.
